# AutoTowersGenerator

### "I ... am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand." - Douglas Adams

This is a Cura plugin that automates the creation of 3D printer calibration towers.  It stems, ultimately, from my own laziness.

There are instructions all over explaining how to generate temperature towers and 5axes even created the incredibly useful "Calibration Shapes" plugin, which does most of the work for you - one click to create the tower model, another few clicks to add a temperature change script.  Viola!

And, yet, it was still too much work for me.  I wondered if it would be possible to automate the process even further.

So, I set out to learn how to write a Cura plugin to automate this entire process.  This plugin is the result.

## Usage
With this plugin, printing a temperature tower can be as easy as:
  1) Click "Auto Towers" from the "Extensions" menu in Cura.
  2) Select the appropriate temperature tower for the material you're using (or create your own custom tower!)
  3) For custom towers, wait a couple minutes for the tower to be generated by OpenSCAD.
  4) Click "Slice" and print, just as you normally would.
  
It's a similar process to create a retraction tower or a fan tower!

This plugin includes various preset towers that can be printed quickly and easily.  However, the real beauty of this plugin comes from the ability to generate customized towers.  For this to work, OpenSCAD must be installed (https://openscad.org/).

## A couple of things to note:

- There is no need to add a post-processing script after creating the tower.  The post-processing is automatically done for you!  

- The tower is generated based on your current layer height.  If the layer height is changed after a tower is created, it will automatically be removed from the scene.  It's easy to recreate it, though!

- The plugin attempts to automatically locate your OpenSCAD executable. If it fails to find it, try specifying the full path in the settings item under the AutoTowersGenerator plugin menu. 

- I've done my best with this plugin, but I'm far from understanding everything about Cura and I'm still fairly new to Python.  I'm confident there are many things that are wrong or could be improved and suggestions are heartily welcomed.  There are few things I excel at, but getting things wrong is one of them.

- Finally, share and enjoy!
